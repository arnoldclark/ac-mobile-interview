# Mob Programming

This session is intended to help us understand how you would approach a very common problem.

We'll need you to create a .NET MAUI application which:

- captures information about a vehicle from a user 
- sends that information to our garage API POST endpoint (this endpoint is already included in this repo, ready for you to use)

We'll also be looking for you to show that you are comfortable navigating your way through a .NET API project

This session is run as a [mob programming session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming), and the end result is less important than the process - we're looking for people who communicate well, are empathetic towards their colleagues, and look for opportunities to share knowledge.

### Taking part in the session

**Please don't write any code before the mob session. We value your time and this startpoint is being provided to take away the element of surprise from the session.**

You'll be joined by a couple of engineers from Arnold Clark. They'll take turns - around 20 minutes each - to take control of the machine and write some code.

This means you'll get the chance to both "drive" and "navigate" during the exercise.

## Resources

Please treat this exercise as if it was part of your normal working day. You can use any resources you need to, such as Google, Stack Overflow etc.

You can also use any packages you want - we would love to find out what your usual workflow looks like!

We've set up a simple project to get you started.
