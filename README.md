# Hello, we're excited to meet you!

Thanks for taking the time to apply for the role of Software Engineer at Arnold Clark. In this part of the interview process, we're looking to assess your technical skills so that we can see how you might fit into our organisation.

## Before we start

We want this to be an enjoyable and comfortable experience for you, and we want the interview process to be a partnership between us.

We are more than happy to make any reasonable adjustments to our process - please let us know at any time, before or during the interview, if there's something that would help.

Common requests include:

- Changes to text size, editor theme, colours and so on
- Asking us to repeat or rephrase questions
- Taking a comfort break to grab a drink or clear your head

We'll try to use clear and simple language as much as we can. We'll also try - as far as possible - to tell you in advance what we'll be discussing so that you feel prepared.

## The Task

For this part of the interview process, we'll ask you to take part in a mob programming exercise to show us how well you work as part of a team. Everything you need to take part in this exercise will be provided on the day.

We also want to be transparent about the skills and traits we're looking for.
